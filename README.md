# MarvelApp (CunningDJ)

This is my first take at a mobile app.  It is created with react native, and tap into the Marvel API to grab and render a random list of Marvel characters.

## Dependencies
1. NodeJS
2. Expo app

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. In the CLI at the base path:
    * Type `npm install`.  This will install the app.
    * Type `npm start`.  This will initialize the app
3. Open the Expo app.
    * If on Android, scan the QR code.
    * If on iOS, type `s` in the CLI, and follow the instructions.
